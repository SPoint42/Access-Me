SQL Inject Me
=============
SQL Inject Me is a part of the Security Compass Exploit-Me series of tools. 
SQL Inject Me is designed to aid in the detection of SQL Injection
vulnerabilities. The tool is a Firefox extension that will execute specific 
attack strings against forms on your website.


Limitations
-----------
SQL Inject Me ships with a default list of error strings which we hope will
help find most SQL Injection errors. However if the application you are testing
has special database related error messages you may wish to add them using the 
options window (Tools->SQL Inject Me->Options->SQL Injection Strings).
