Access Me
=============
Access Me is a part of the Security Compass Exploit-Me series of tools. 
Access Me is designed to aid in the detection of unauthenticated access
vulnerabilities. The tool is a Firefox extension that will execute recreate
your authenticated request and then try a series of unauthenicated and
malformed requests for that same protected resources


Limitations
-----------
Access Me ships with a default list of regular expressions which we hope will
match most session ids. However if the application you are testing has some
special session ids then you can configure using (Tools->Access Me ->Options->
Params To Test).
